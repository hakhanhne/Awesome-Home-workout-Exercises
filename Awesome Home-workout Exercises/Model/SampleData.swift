        description: """
        For super strong ab lines! Includes classical gym exercises & is weight lifting inspired ‚ô•Ô∏é You need a weight or a heavy bottle of water & a something elevated (bench or chair) / Werbung

        Bodyweight vs. Weights:
        ‚ñ∏ I love & do both. I think the combination of both types gives the best results!
        ‚ñ∏ You can grow stronger and bigger muscles with Weight Training. You basically handle more weight during the exercise, than you usually carry around on your body all day. That‚Äôs why your body needs to adapt and create ‚Äûextra‚Äú muscle fibers, that you usually don‚Äôt need. If you stop seeing progress with bodyweight training, you should consider getting some dumbbells.
        ‚ñ∏ Those exercises also ask for a lot of stability (e.g. the Ab Slide), making sure we train our entire torso, waist, back & arms.
        ‚ñ∏ However, weight exercises usually don‚Äôt burn so much for me. I like to combine them with bodyweight movements so I can really target the little muscles, exhaust them and train until they burn like fireeee.
         
        Muscles:
        We train everything from upper to lower & side abs. I also included a lot of twisting movements for the waist line, which helps to get the 11 ab lines :)

        PS: YES this workout includes breaks :D

        Equipment: 8kg dumbbell

        description: """
        .. Ready for a KILLER routine? on a positive note: it's only 10 minutes & the music is amazing! ‚ô•Ô∏é / Werbung

        I know, we have a love-hate relationship to my 15min HIIT workout. Me too, I admit that.
        A 10min routine was definitely missing on my channel! Still a killer, still burning lots of calories, still breaking a sweat.. but: it's only 10 minutes :D

        This workout is:
        1. FILLED WITH BASICS.
        Nothing too fancy, nothing too dancy. Ask your male partner to join! They won't need to shake their hips for this one.
        2. a mix out of "QUICK MOVEMENTS" and "ACTIVE BREAKS".
        You will find Dolphin Holds & Planks in between all the quick movements. Almost feels like a break, but don't forget to keep the core strength :D
        3. HIGH ENERGY.
        For some reason it doesn't drag me down - but rather gives me MORE energy! Might also be the music though.

        by the way: NO LUNGES.

        __

        If you struggle or need a break: don't worry about it. Take a small rest, get something to drink & continue once you're ready :) most important is that you don't quit and push yourself.

        ‚ñ∏ Depending on your fitness level, height and weight you will burn between 70-130 kcal.
        I burned about 80kcal in those 10min (which is a lot for me, I'm a small human and I normally burn about 250kcal in a 1h session).

        description: """
        Yaaaaay - our first workout WITH WEIGHTS! If you don't have any weights home - don't worry! I got you ‚ô•Ô∏é / Werbung

        I use a 10kg / 22 lbs dumbbell. Choose a weight that feels good for you!
        Weights help us to increase the intensity of a workout, build rounder muscles (booty alarm) and make us stronger!

        Your home-made weight:
        1. Take a bag
        2. Search for dense + heavy food in your kitchen. For example: packs of flour, rice, oats, etc.
        3. You can easily put 6 to 10 packs into one bag. That makes 6 to 10 kg :)

        This workout is structured like this:
        - a Booty Activation, without equipment
        - 6 Supersets, including 1-2 weighted exercise(s) and a bodyweight burner
        - a Burnout with 6min of Glute Bridges, to make those butt cheeks buuuuurn

        Things to keep in mind:
        ‚ñ∏ bodyweight focusses on your HEELS, don't shift your bodyweight onto your toes
        ‚ñ∏ your BACK stays STRAIGHT. Don't round it!
        ‚ñ∏ keep your KNEES stable. Never collapse them inwards, rather push them a bit outwards
        ‚ñ∏ squeeze your BOOTY as hard as possible and hold the tension as long as possible, if you have troubles with only growing your thighs.

        The routine includes breaks! Yes, that's correct. BREAKS! :D
        The video is in full length which means you can just follow whatever I‚Äôm doing.

        We isolate the butt muscles & train them without using a lot of thigh strength. This way we can grow our booty, not the legs :)
